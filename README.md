This was the final project that I worked on with a partner for CECS 361 Digital Design Techniques and Verifications. We implemented the simple game 
Tic-Tac-Toe in Vivado and had 7 modules that each were used to represent the rules of the game and detect a winner amongst two players. 
It was designed to work on the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board that handled the circuit simulation and was paired with 9 RGB LEDs placed on
a breadboard to create a visual display board for the two players. It used on-board dip switches on the A7-100T to take inputs from the two players
